### To consider for the Desert Numerique 05:

![possible locations](https://raw.github.com/alejoduque/dronetones/master/imgs/possible_locations_opt.png)
- The festival will be shorter in time. First week of July?
- There's interest on having a round table or discussion about the political aspect.
- Define location of the performance and consider bringing everyone to this location (see image above).
- Having 220V in the field can be hard so we should relay on battery powered operations.
- Performance can be on saturday or sunday. (At dusk?)
- We have to define a [[budget]].
