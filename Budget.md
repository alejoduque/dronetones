### Planes:

We will build them and recycle but might have to fix things in St. Nazaire so having tape, glue, depron or similar at hand should be good. In the case of electrical powered devices it will be good to have spare motors, propellers and ESC's for 2 planes.

### Schematics for a possible plane design:
![shematics](https://raw.github.com/alejoduque/dronetones/master/imgs/shematics_BN.jpg)

#### For a 1.1m widespan plane built using : 
- foam core (x1/2)
- 1x100x1000mm (x2) balsa wood
- 2x100x1000mm balsa wood
- 0.5x3x1000mm carbon bar
- 3x10x1000mm samba wood
- 1mm CAP + tube (x2)
- kraft paper
- misc material
- glue

the cost of 3 planes (materials) + electronic + batteries should be around 250â‚¬
### things to buy:
- materials for building 3 identical planes (wood / tape / paper / glue / likage stopper)
- 3 motors
- 3 ESC
- 3 receiver for tgx9 (or 2 + 1 for an other transmitter box? or maybe just 2 if you have a spare one)
- 3 battery pack (or 4)?
- 12 micro servos (or maybe we should have 2 spare)?
- 2 set of 3 propeller
- prop saver + lot's of rubber
- various connectors
- misc item

### Guiding Systems:

Is possible to automate any of the flying devices using something like the ArduPilot that has already a very advanced interface:

Other more simple ways could follow the principles of the glider category F1A or F1H that follow simple patterns and depend on thermal lift. We can certainly add powered systems an even consider 
a VSI (vertical speed indicator) to ascertain that level flight is being maintained. A simpler type does not need an external source of power and can therefore be relied upon to function regardless of whether a battery or power source has been fitted. The electronic type with audio needs a power source to be operative during the flight.

### Batteries:

Depending on the kind of plane we should get some new batteries, also for powering the FPV system:

### Adapter/Cables:

It will be handy to have a couple of connectors and cables at hand to patch things if required.
XT-60, Futaba, JST, T-Connector, Micro T-Connector, HXT-4mm

### Transport  (as in travel expenses & usually covered):
