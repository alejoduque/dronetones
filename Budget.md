### Planes:

We will build them and recycle but might have to fix things in St. Nazaire so having tape, glue, depron or similar at hand should be good. 

In the case of electrical powered devices it will be good to have spare motors, propellers and ESC's for 2 planes.

### building planes (example)

#### 1.1m plane can be build using : 
- foam core ( x1/2)
- 1x100x1000mm (x2) balsa wood
- 2x100x1000mm (x1/2) balsa wood
- 0.5x3x1000mm carbon bar
- 5x5x1000mm samba wood
- kraft paper
- misc material
- glue

the cost of 3 planes (materials) + electronic + batteries should be around 250â‚¬

### Guiding systems:

If we decide to automate any of the devices (sound wise) we should list here the type of controller.

-micro-controllers

-sensors

-LED lights

### Batteries:

Depending on the kind of plane we should get some new batteries, also for powering the FPV system:

### Adapter/Cables:

XT-60, Futaba, JST, T-Connector, Micro T-Connector, HXT-4mm

### Transport  (as in travel expenses & usually covered):
