### Planes:

We will build them and recycle but might have to fix things in St. Nazaire so having tape, glue, depron or similar at hand should be good. 

In the case of electrical powered devices it will be good to have spare motors, propellers and ESC's for 2 planes.

the cost of 3 planes (materials) + electronic + batteries should be around 250â‚¬

### Guiding systems:

If we decide to automate any of the devices (sound wise) we should list here the type of controller.

-micro-controllers

-sensors

-LED lights

### Batteries:

Depending on the kind of plane we should get some new batteries, also for powering the FPV system:

### Adapter/Cables:

XT-60, Futaba, JST, T-Connector, Micro T-Connector, HXT-4mm

### Transport  (as in travel expenses & usually covered):
