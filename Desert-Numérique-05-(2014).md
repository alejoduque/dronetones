### To consider for the Desert Numerique 05:

![possible locations](https://raw.github.com/alejoduque/dronetones/master/imgs/possible_locations_opt.png)
- The festival will be shorter in time. First week of July?
- There's interest on having a round table or discussion about the political aspect.
- Define location of the performance and consider bringing everyone to this location (see image above).
- Having 220V in the field can be hard so we should relay on battery powered operations.
- Performance can be on saturday or sunday. (At dusk?)
- We have to define a [[budget]].
-

4 variables:


- Space near the camping.
- Distance of 100mts to 200mts will be the ideal.
- View from the town for the pilots.
- Throwing things to the plane. (optional).



FPV (First Person View) This is the video signal comes from the plane. comes in 500mts from the plane to the place where the video is to be viewed.



The discussion is still on the program.



Time of the day:

    

    10:00 dusk is too late and is also eat time 8pm to 10pm



It should be earlier for the video, both for viewing and and for for recording from the plane.



We could also make a later flight with LED lights in between concerts.
