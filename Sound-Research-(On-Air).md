#Interventions/Instrumental Planes 

* Antennas already produce sound while hanging out in the air. Having a string (piano wire) inside the fuselage connected to a fin that is outside and vibrates, it could be actually linked to the ailerons one can use the resonant space within the fuselage as a sound producing space.
* Antennas producing sound can easily be moved by a servos motor in order to switch sound on/off
* having paper or plastic layer (1x10cm about) fixed at diferent positions (on the propeller, on the front of the wing, at the end of the wing, etc), that will "flapflap" depending on the plane velocity
* flute / whistle
* a fixed rigid plastic that hurt the motor (or propeller) during it's rotation
* electronic beeper
